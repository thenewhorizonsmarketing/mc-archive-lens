## Features

### Loading Indicator

When you open a flipbook, you'll see a loading spinner while the publication initializes. This typically takes 1-3 seconds depending on the publication size.

### Fullscreen Experience

Flipbooks display in fullscreen mode for an immersive reading experience. The viewer automatically adjusts to your screen size.

### Realistic Page Turning

The flipbook simulates realistic page-turning animations, creating a natural magazine-reading experience on the touchscreen.

## Troubleshooting

### Flipbook Won't Load

**Problem:** The flipbook displays a loading spinner indefinitely or shows an error message.

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection (if flipbooks are hosted remotely)
2. Try closing and reopening the flipbook
3. If a PDF version is available, use the "View PDF" button as an alternative
4. Contact the system administrator if the problem persists

### Pages Won't Turn

**Problem:** Swiping or tapping doesn't change pages.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're swiping across the page area (not the header)
2. Try using the on-screen arrow buttons instead
3. Wait for the current page animation to complete before turning again
4. Refresh the flipbook by closing and reopening it

### Flipbook Appears Blurry or Pixelated

**Problem:** Page images appear low quality or blurry.

**Solutions:**
1. Use the zoom controls to adjust the view
2. Wait for high-resolution images to fully load
3. Check if the flipbook supports higher quality settings
4. Contact the administrator if all flipbooks appear low quality

### Close Button Not Responding

**Problem:** Tapping the close button doesn't exit the flipbook.

**Solutions:**
1. Try pressing the **Escape** key on a connected keyboard
2. Tap the close button again (ensure you're tapping the button area)
3. Wait a moment and try again (the flipbook may be processing)
4. If stuck, restart the kiosk application

### Flipbook Controls Are Too Small

**Problem:** Navigation buttons are difficult to tap on the touchscreen.

**Solutions:**
1. Use swipe gestures instead of buttons for navigation
2. Tap near the center of buttons for better accuracy
3. Contact the administrator to adjust touch target sizes

## Tips for Best Experience

### Navigation

- **Use Swipe Gestures:** Swiping is often faster and more intuitive than tapping buttons
- **Wait for Animations:** Let page-turning animations complete before navigating again
- **Use Page Counter:** Check the page counter to see how much content remains

### Reading

- **Zoom When Needed:** Use zoom controls for small text or detailed images
- **Take Your Time:** The flipbook will remain open until you close it
- **Explore Interactive Elements:** Some flipbooks may include clickable links or interactive content

### Performance

- **First Load May Be Slower:** The initial load downloads assets; subsequent pages load faster
- **Close When Finished:** Close the flipbook when done to free up system resources
- **Report Issues:** If you experience consistent performance problems, inform the administrator

## Accessibility

If using a keyboard with the kiosk:

- **Escape:** Close the flipbook viewer

- **Tab:** Navigate through interactive elements

### Screen Reader Support
